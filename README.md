## About
Use the D3 Use Leaflet to plot a map of current earthquake data from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php

## Getting Started
All files are located in the leaflet-challenge repository. The index.html is at the root level. The logic.js is in the js folder and the stylesheet is located in the css folder.


## Installing
This was generated using Visual Studio 1.82.2  on a Windows 10 Pro system and Chrome 116.0.5845.188.


## Usage
Open the index.html file which should autopoulate with a map marked with circles that represent earthquakes. If you click on a circle a popup will appear containing information about the earthquake.








## Contributing
Thank you to CG:AF at Central Grading for refering me to https://community.codenewbie.org/kwing25/how-to-write-a-good-readme-for-your-project-16ej. I have used this as a template instead of the template from the Gitlab repository for class. Hopefully y'all like it better.

The following website was helpful for syntax or understanding how things worked. \

Special thanks to Christopher Hornung for helping me get unstuck.
